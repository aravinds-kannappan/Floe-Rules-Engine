# NLP-Powered Rules Engine for Healthcare Workflows

A semantic rule processing engine that transforms natural language business rules into executable healthcare appointment workflows. Designed for healthcare professionals to create automated patient communication rules without technical syntax requirements.

## Overview

This system enables healthcare staff to write rules in plain English and automatically generate appropriate patient communications (SMS, Email, Voice calls) based on appointment data, patient preferences, and clinical context.

**Example Rule:**
```
"If high risk patients have appointments tomorrow then send urgent SMS"
```

**Generated Output:**
```
SMS to (555) 123-4567: "URGENT: Sarah, please confirm your Oncology appointment tomorrow at 2:00 PM. Call us at (555) 987-6543."
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Semantic Parser**: Transforms natural language into structured conditions with confidence scoring
- **Rule Engine**: Multi-threaded evaluation engine with intelligent caching
- **Action Generator**: Context-aware template system for SMS, Email, and Voice communications
- **Data Layer**: In-memory cache with indexed access to patient, appointment, and practice data

### Key Design Features

#### Semantic Understanding
The engine understands healthcare-specific terminology and context:
- Risk levels (high, medium, low)
- Time expressions (tomorrow, within 6 hours, soon)
- Appointment types (oncology, MRI, PT session)
- Patient languages (Spanish, English)
- Communication preferences

#### Confidence Scoring
Each rule interpretation receives a confidence score (0.0-1.0) based on:
- Parsing certainty for individual conditions
- Coverage ratio of matched conditions
- Context clarity and specificity

Results are ranked by confidence to show most relevant matches first.

#### Dynamic Template Generation
Templates adapt to context automatically:
- **Urgency detection**: "urgent", "important" keywords trigger priority messaging
- **Language awareness**: Automatic Spanish/English template selection
- **Appointment-specific**: Templates include relevant appointment details
- **Practice branding**: Messages include practice name and contact information

## Design Parameters and Tradeoffs

### Performance Optimization
- **In-memory caching**: O(1) data lookups for sub-second response times
- **Multi-threading**: 4-worker thread pool for concurrent rule evaluation
- **Early termination**: Stops processing when sufficient matches are found
- **Rule caching**: Prevents re-parsing of identical rules

### Accuracy vs Speed
- **Choice**: Custom semantic parsing over full NLP analysis
- **Benefit**: Predictable 50ms parsing time vs 500ms+ for deep learning models
- **Tradeoff**: May miss creative phrasings but ensures healthcare safety through predictable interpretation

### Memory vs Database
- **Choice**: Full dataset pre-loading vs database queries
- **Benefit**: 10x faster queries, consistent response times
- **Tradeoff**: ~150MB memory usage, limited to memory-bounded datasets

### Flexibility vs Complexity
- **Choice**: Natural language input vs structured rule syntax
- **Benefit**: Healthcare professionals require no technical training
- **Tradeoff**: Complex parsing logic vs simple rule evaluation

## System Capabilities

### Supported Condition Types
- **Risk Assessment**: Patient no-show risk levels
- **Time-based**: Appointment timing and urgency
- **Status Tracking**: Intake completion, appointment status
- **Demographics**: Patient language preferences
- **Clinical**: Appointment types and locations
- **Practice**: Multi-practice support with practice-specific rules

### Communication Channels
- **SMS**: Mobile-optimized messages with character limits
- **Email**: Rich formatting with subject lines and practice branding
- **Voice**: Call scripts for staff or automated systems

### Context-Aware Features
- **Patient Communication Preferences**: Respects opt-out and channel preferences
- **Multi-language Support**: Automatic Spanish/English detection and templates
- **Practice Integration**: Includes practice-specific contact information and branding
- **Appointment Details**: Rich context from appointment, patient, and intake data

## Scalability Characteristics

### Current Capacity
- **Data Volume**: Optimized for ~10,000 appointments
- **Concurrent Processing**: 4-thread concurrent rule evaluation
- **Rule Complexity**: Supports 5-10 conditions per rule efficiently
- **Response Time**: Sub-second processing for typical healthcare rules

### Scaling Limitations
- **Memory Bounded**: Limited by available RAM for data cache
- **Single Machine**: Thread-based concurrency bound by CPU cores
- **Cache Refresh**: Manual data reload required for updates

### Future Scaling Path
- **Database Integration**: Hybrid cache + database for 100K+ appointments
- **Distributed Processing**: Microservices architecture for horizontal scaling
- **Real-time Updates**: Event-driven processing for live data synchronization

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Graceful Degradation
- **Optional Dependencies**: Core functionality works without NLP libraries
- **Partial Failures**: Individual action failures don't break entire rule processing
- **Missing Data**: Handles incomplete patient or appointment records gracefully
- **Malformed Rules**: Provides confidence scores for ambiguous interpretations

### Data Validation
- **Cross-reference Integrity**: Validates relationships between patients, appointments, and practices
- **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed condition and action processing
- **Context Validation**: Ensures required fields are available for template generation

## Technical Implementation

### Rule Processing Pipeline
1. **Natural Language Input**: Parse free-form rule text
2. **Semantic Analysis**: Extract conditions and actions with confidence scoring
3. **Data Evaluation**: Multi-threaded evaluation against appointment dataset
4. **Context Building**: Assemble rich context from multiple data sources
5. **Action Generation**: Create contextually appropriate communications
6. **Result Ranking**: Sort by confidence score for optimal user experience

### Data Integration
The system integrates five core healthcare datasets:
- **Practices**: Healthcare facilities and configuration
- **Patients**: Demographics, preferences, and communication settings
- **Appointments**: Scheduling data with risk assessments
- **Intakes**: Patient intake status and completion tracking
- **Events**: Historical communication and appointment events

### Template System
Templates automatically adapt based on detected context:
```python
# Urgent appointment reminder
"URGENT: {patient_first_name}, please confirm your {appointment_type} appointment."

# Spanish language template  
"Hola {patient_first_name}, recordatorio sobre su cita de {appointment_type}."

# Standard reminder
"Hi {patient_first_name}, reminder about your {appointment_type} appointment at {practice_name}."
```

## Use Cases
